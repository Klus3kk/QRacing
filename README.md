# QRacing (Failed Version)

**QRacing** is a 2D racing game designed to teach an AI how to navigate a track as quickly as possible. Developed using the Pygame library, the game features a simple racing environment where the objective is to reach the finish line as efficiently as possible.

## Game Overview

In QRacing, you control a car on a 2D track, and the car's goal is to cross the finish line. The game is designed to use Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning, to help the AI model learn how to drive the car to the finish line in the fastest time. Players have one speed boost available per game to aid in their efforts.

## Issues

Unfortunately, the game has some issues:
- **Learning Algorithm:** The AI does not seem to be learning effectively. The Q-learning model isn't improving as expected, which means the AI's driving skills aren't getting better over time.
- **Sensors:** The sensors designed to detect collisions and track boundaries aren't functioning as intended. This impacts the AI's ability to navigate the track correctly.
